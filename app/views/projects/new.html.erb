    <dt class="text-info"><h2>The donation process</h2></dt>
    Giving blood is simple and it saves lives. When you give blood, it is collected so it can be used to treat someone else.</br>

    For most people, giving blood is easy and follows the simple steps listed below. See our animation which takes you through what happens step by step.</br></br>

    <dt class="text-info">When you give blood</dt>

    This is what will happen when you attend your appointment, or go to a drop-in session, to give blood. If you attend an appointment to give blood we aim to ensure it takes no more than an hour.</br></br>
    <dt class="text-info">1. Welcome and preparation</dt>

    We will ask you to read our Welcome leaflet which explains the importance of blood safety. Itâ€™s important to read this whenever you attend because advice does change. We will give you 500ml of fluid just before you give blood. Drinking this over about 5 minutes will help with your well-being during and after donation.</br></br>

    <dt class="text-info">2. Health screening</dt>

    We make sure it is safe for you to donate, and that your blood donation is safe for a patient to receive.</br></br>

    * We confirm your identity and ask you about the information on your donor health check form; a registered nurse may follow up if necessary.</br>
    * We test a drop of blood from your finger to check the iron levels (haemoglobin) in your blood.
    </br></br>
    If you are not able to donate we will explain why, and may ask you to make another appointment.</br>
    If you are able to donate you will be asked to sit in a waiting area until you are called to a donation chair.</br></br>

    <dt class="text-info">3. Your blood donation</dt>

    When you are comfortable on the chair we will ask you to confirm your name, address and date of birth.</br>

    We examine your arm and place a cuff on your arm to maintain a small amount of pressure during donation (this does not measure blood pressure).</br>

    We then examine your arm to find a suitable vein and clean it with an antiseptic sponge.</br></br>

    1. We will insert a needle in your arm which will collect your blood into a blood bag with your unique donor number.</br>
    2. You should not feel any discomfort or pain. If you do, tell a member of staff.</br>
    3. A scale weighs the blood and stops when you have donated 470ml (or just under a pint). This usually takes between 5-10 minutes.</br>
    4. The needle will be removed and a sterile dressing applied to your arm.</br>
